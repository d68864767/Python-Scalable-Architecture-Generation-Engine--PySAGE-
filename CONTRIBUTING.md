# Contributing to Python Scalable Architecture Generation Engine (PySAGE)

First off, thank you for considering contributing to PySAGE. It's people like you that make PySAGE such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make sure to check our [Issues](https://github.com/your-username/PySAGE/issues) page to see if someone else in the community has already created a ticket. If not, go ahead and make one!

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then fork PySAGE and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

```bash
git checkout -b 325-add-japanese-localisation
```

## Implement your fix or feature

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.

## Get the code

The first thing you'll need to do is to fork PySAGE:

1. In GitHub, navigate to the [PySAGE repository](https://github.com/your-username/PySAGE).
2. In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.

## Make the change

1. Follow the "Installation" instructions in the README.md to get started.
2. If you're adding a feature and the change is large, it might be a good idea to discuss it on the Issues page first.

## Test the change

Make sure your changes pass our tests. To do this, run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

## Push it

Push your changes to your fork:

```bash
git push origin my-fix-branch
```

## Make a pull request

1. Navigate to your fork on GitHub.
2. Click the 'Compare & pull request' button next to your branch.
3. Review your changes in the comparison view, and when you're ready, click 'Create pull request'.

## And you're done!

At this point, you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

- Write tests.
- Follow our [code style guide](https://github.com/your-username/PySAGE/wiki/Code-style-guide).
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

Thank you for your contributions!
